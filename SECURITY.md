## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have an active [bug-bounty program](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/bug-bounties/1) with Sherlock where you can report any vulnerabilities satisfying the conditions as stated on their website. We prefer you submit reports through that avenue. However, if you need to contact us directly for any emergencies, please email chinmay@dhedge.org or ermin@dhedge.org.
